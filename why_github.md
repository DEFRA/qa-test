# Why GitHub?

We work in the open by default and GitHub is the easiest way to do this. It has the advantages of being:

* free (unlike Confluence)
* secure (unlike free Google Docs)
* open to all (unlike Sharepoint or an intranet)
* accessible from off-network machines (unlike Sharepoint)
* easy to collaborate on (unlike an intranet)

GitHub has two main disadvantages:

* Internet Explorer is not formally supported. It is still usable, but if you can, we recommend accessing it through Chrome.
* It can appear daunting if you've never used it before.

However, there is a wealth of information available on how to use GitHub. See [the GitHub page](/github) for more information.
